Second Max of Three Numbers
Problem Statement
Write a program that accepts sets of three numbers, and prints the second-maximum number among the three.

Input
First line contains the number of triples, N.
The next N lines which follow each have three space separated integers.
Output
For each of the N triples, output one new line which contains the second-maximum integer among the three.
SOLUTION:
# cook your dish here
n=int(input())
for i in range(n):
    a=list(map(int,input().split()))
    a.sort()
    print(a[-2])
