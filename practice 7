A blood drive aims to collect 
𝑁
N number of blood donations.
The drive has collected 
𝑋
X donations so far. Find the remaining number of donations needed to reach the target.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer 
𝑇
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case contains two space-separated integers 
𝑁
N and 
𝑋
X — the number of required donations and the number of collected donations, respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the remaining number of donations needed to reach the target.
