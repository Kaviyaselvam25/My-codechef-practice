Reach the Target
There is a cricket match going on between two teams 
𝐴
A and 
𝐵
B.

Team 
𝐵
B is batting second and got a target of 
𝑋
X runs. Currently, team 
𝐵
B has scored 
𝑌
Y runs. Determine how many more runs Team 
𝐵
B should score to win the match.

Note: The target score in cricket matches is one more than the number of runs scored by the team that batted first.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer 
𝑇
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two space-separated integers 
𝑋
X and 
𝑌
Y, the target for team 
𝐵
B and the current score of team 
𝐵
B respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, output how many more runs team 
𝐵
B should score to win the match.
